VSCode extension for ZenML

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To contribute to the ZenML VSCode extension, you'll need to set up a development environment. This includes forking and cloning the extension repository, and setting up a ZenML stack for testing purposes.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Go to https://github.com/zenml-io/vscode-zenml and fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Extension Repository

Clone the extension repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-zenml.git
cd vscode-zenml
```

### 3. Set Up a ZenML Stack (if you don't already have one)

For testing the extension, you'll need an actual stack to test commands on. For a quick setup, follow the [ZenML "A starter project" guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/starter-project) to set up a starter project.
